title: Understanding Tensor Flow : Part 1
---
Tensor Flow deep learning library released by google is intended for experienced machine learning enthusiastics and data scientist. But those experienced ones are also having problem understanding Tensor Flow and how to apply its to solve their learning problems.

Through this blog post, I intend to simplfy tensor flow and explain in terms of data flow graph so that it would be easier for us to understand tensor flow and use it to solve our learning problems.

#Quiz: What is Data Flow Graph (DFG) ?

To understand tensor flow, first we need to know basics of Data Flow Graph. I qill explain basics of DFG. For details on DFG if you find it interesting please read this good paper on DFG. <DFG Paper Link>
