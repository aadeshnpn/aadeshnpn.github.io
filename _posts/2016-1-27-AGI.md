This post contains a bit modified transcript of the presentation that I presented at Russian Culture Center, Kamalpokhari, Nepal for AI Doom or Boom seminar organised by CSIT Nepal.

#Who will run this world human or machine?

In this blog post, I will give insight on who will rule this planet earth machine or human. This blog post is divided into four sub-categories.

###How the debate got started ?
###Can machine learn like Human?
###Human Vs Machine?
###Will machine be extinct?

##How the debate got started?
Lets dig deep into how the debate started? Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as the intelligence exhibited by machines. The field of AI dates back to 1955, when it was first coined by John Macarthy. At first, the purpose of AI at that point of time was to build agents that would deliver specific tasks. Now, till date AI is very mature and used ubiquitously. AI is present in your phone, internet search, Facebook, Netflix, Amazon and everywhere. In fact, we cannot imagine all the technological advancements of today with out use of AI. This wide use of AI in all most every field from Physic to Law made some of the intellectual mind like Steven Hawkings, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs to raise concern  in AI. In addition, Elon Musk has donated around $10,000,000 for research in safe AI. Also, above 300 researchers, scientists and visionaries has signed the open document to prevent AI from taking over humans. In contrast, AI celebrity , and AI head of Baidu, Andrew Ng promulgated that we don't need to worry about Machine taking over humans. He says, “Worrying about Machines taking over humans is just like worrying about overpopulation in mars.” As far as AI research are concerned, it would take more than 50 years for singularity to arrive. But we can't neglate  the facts that, hackers can gain access over there AI machines and try to do something malicious. Naturally, AI won't attact us until there is some human commander to order so. In this respect, the concern shown by Elon Musk and others seems valid.

##Can machine learn like Human?
To learn about how human being are considered intelligence we must be able to define intelligence coherently. But there are many different definition of AI and still there is no definition that satisfies everyone. However, there is wide agreement among artificial researchers that intelligence being is required to do following:
→ Reason, use strategy, solve puzzels and make judgment under uncertainity.
→ Represent knowledge, including common sense
→ Plan
→ Learn
→ Communicate in natural language
→ And integrate all there skills towards common goal

##Then what is learning ?
Learning is the act of acquiring new, or modifying and reinforcing existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information. Through different sensors and sense organs, signal are transferred through nerves to brain. The vast cloud of neurons in brain process  those information and stores it. To examplify this learning process, lets take example of how Human beings learn.
We take most of our abilities as for granted. But to acquire those abilities it took lot of time for us. For example, our ability to recognize a person's face in an illuminated condition, ability to walk, play sports, talk and communicate with others.
